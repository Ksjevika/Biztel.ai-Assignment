1. Read the words_position_dict.txt file: Parse the bounding box positions of each word stored in the file. This file contains information about the words and their scaled bounding box dimensions.
2. Scale the bounding boxes to actual dimensions: Using the document dimensions (Width=1263, Height=1644), calculate the actual bounding box dimensions of each word.
3. Check for overlap: For each word, check if its bounding box falls within the user-drawn bounding box [x1, y1, x3, y3].
4. Output the words: Return the list of words enclosed within the user-drawn bounding box.
